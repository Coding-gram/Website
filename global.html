    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <img class="i1" src="climatec.jpg" width="35" height="475">
    <p>Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions.Climate change has already caused significant impacts on the environment, including food and water scarcities, sea level rise, and economic instability.1 The changes in climate have increased water temperatures of rivers and lakes, decreased ice cover, thereby affecting water quality and freshwater ecosystems. The impacts of climate change, such as increasing sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, and shifts in currents and wind patterns, will significantly alter the physical and biological make-up of the oceans.3 Climate change has already altered marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems all around the world, causing species losses and declines in key ecosystem services. These climate-driven impacts on ecosystems have caused measurable economic and livelihood losses around the world.2 Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety, and work, and some people are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries.0</p>

    <h2>Deforestation</h2>
    <img class="i2" src="d.jpg">
    <p>Deforestation is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then converted to non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests.Deforestation has a significant impact on the environment and ecosystems.4 It weakens and degrades the soil, leading to low yields and food insecurity.0 The loss of ecological services provided by tropical rainforests and related ecosystems is the most immediate impact of deforestation.2 Deforestation also leads to a loss of biodiversity, climate change, and decline in soil fertility.4 About 80% of the global biodiversity is located in tropical rainforests, which provide habitats for wildlife and foster medicinal conservation.5 The rate of deforestation equals to a loss of 20 football fields every minute.1 Without trees, less water evaporates into the atmosphere, causing the land to become drier and less stable.3</p></div><div class="3">
    <h2>Pollution</h2>
    <img class="i3" src="i3.jpg">
    <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.Our environment faces several problems and many of these seem to be worsening with time, bringing us into a time of a true environmental crisis. Therefore enhancing public awareness of these problems is essential to lessen their detrimental effects. Environmental pollution is increasing day by day and imposing severe and irreversible damage to the world. It is of different types: air, water, soil, noise, light, etc. Urbanization and technological development have put the survival of the planet in danger by degrading the quality of the environment’s essential elements—air, water and soil—due to the release of hazardous waste from factories like plastics, heavy metals, nitrates, burning of fossil fuels, acid rain, oil spills and industrial toxins. Urbanization and overpopulation have increased city noise and light pollution. Polluting agents are exponentially increasing in modern society, disturbing the ecological balance and posing extinction problems for different animal and bird species. This is because the destruction of plants, especially trees, by acid rains disturbs the natural environment of animals. The effect of pollution on the health of human being is well known, but it is a dire need to understand the link between environmental pollutants and mental health. In terms of strategies to solve the upcoming issues regarding environmental health, planning followed by action should be considered as a ground base for the manifestation of desired results in this direction. The possible solutions may include switching to eco-friendly electric vehicles, encouraging shared mobility, replacing fossil fuels with sustainable renewables like solar, wind, etc., and promoting green building. This chapter broadly reviews the causes of environmental pollution, its impact on living forms and the possible solutions to minimize the irreparable losses to nature and us.</p></div>

    <h2>Overpopulation</h2>
    <img class="i4" src="i4.jpg">
    <p>Overpopulation is an undesirable condition where the number of existing human population exceeds the carrying capacity of Earth. Overpopulation is caused by number of factors. Reduced mortality rate, better medical facilities, depletion of precious resources are few of the causes which result in overpopulation.Overpopulation is a severe environmental and economic issue that affects the planet.03 It leads to the depletion of resources, such as water and food, which is falling short of the current needs.3 Over-farming, deforestation, water pollution, eutrophication, and global warming are some of the negative impacts of overpopulation.0 Forests and other habitats are disturbed or destroyed to construct urban areas, and more land is used for agricultural activities to grow crops and support livestock.1 Acts of violence and aggression outside of a war zone have increased tremendously while competing for resources.3 Rising sea levels are one of the greatest dangers, and coastal areas currently inhabited by 300 million people are set to experience annual flooding by 2050, unless measures are taken to hold back the water. Overpopulation causes territorial conflicts over water supply, which can end in war, and environmental degradation due to unbridled use of natural resources and growth in energy production from fossil fuels</p></div>

    <h2>Waste Disposal</h2>
    <img class="i5" src="i5.jpg">
    <p>The overconsumption of resources and creation of plastics are creating a global crisis of waste disposal. Developed countries are notorious for producing an excessive amount of waste or garbage and dumping their waste in the oceans and, less developed countries.</p></div><div class="5">
    <h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
    <img class="i6" src="i6.jpg">
    <p>Loss of biodiversity is the decrease in biodiversity including the extinction of species worldwide or in a particular habitat. The loss is more severe in so-called biodiversity hotspots, areas that harbor a large proportion of species not found anywhere else and are experiencing habitat loss.</p></div><div class="6">
    <h2>Ozone Layer Depletion</h2>
    <img class="i7" src="i7.jpg">
    <p>Ozone layer depletion is the thinning of the earth's ozone layer caused by the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous chlorine or bromine from industry and other human activities. The thinning is most pronounced in the polar regions, especially over Antarctica.</p></div></div>
